#Things to do

documentation for the whole thing

let proced wth my requets dditional context though.

expand feature set, as i metioned above, along with these:
fix android one, it has some flaws here and there, 
ie when running it just ays starting, and when i stop ot the app doenst 
see to be in synch with what its evidently doing

#safetly mechanisms,
ie nuke my prevos data, kill node and al my information,
i can chose my node name, and add infoe and upadte ot as needed
verify everything is encryted
create pin on first toem running, so that wecan protect the app from unauthorized access
a way to find a tunnel to the inetnet iem a node that is conected to the internet, ie fining the way out
if i have internet conectcon, i sort of have a beacon that showa im the way out for my mesh
a nice doc that describes the app featirs on first run to be able to tell use abut all 
 much betr UI, we wan feel like an actual app, not a proof of concept, we want to be able to do 
things like see the devices in the mesh, see their info, and be able to interact with them, like send messages, files, etc

when i have 1000 devices in a mesh, we ulcok more featires like broadcast, SOS, broadcast lication
hopefull
